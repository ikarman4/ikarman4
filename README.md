Hi I’m Ian! 
I'm a signal processing and machine learning researcher focused on neurotechnology and wearables. I work with all sorts of bio-sensors collecting tons of different data to train models to do a lot of cool things.
You can check out my last publication, [Generating Breathing Patterns In Real Time]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18NfAzYl2hCUBHqPYbYrvm0k3e9ZtNCXA/view?usp=sharing)), for reference. My team and I were able to generate breathing signals in real time with low latency only using a 25hz ppg sensor. Send over any questions anytime peoples! 

Thanks!
