Hi, I’m Ian Karman (@ikarman4) and I am passionate about data science within the world of neurotechnology and sports performance. 
I have worked across many languages and platforms but have the most extensive experience with Python and MATLAB. I have over 1 year of professional experience and
over 3 years in academic experience. I am confident with packages such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn and am able to adapt to any new
concurrent packages and libraries. In the past year I have had the experience to construct an entire pipeline for in house data reports for BrainCo. This involved
accessing and pulling from an API, cleaning and prepping raw data, sorting storage structure across API metrics, and creating a visualization toolset for
displaying the desired metrics and timelines along with categorizing and binning parameters. This datapipeline was a great opportunity for myself to discover working
with a coworker on a remote software project. I quickly learned how to pull, stage, commit, and push in Git while I found strength in working with a team member.
My current learning interests are using more advanced machine learning libraries and tools as well as studying deep learning. (2021)
